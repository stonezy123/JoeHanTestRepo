In this tutorial, you deploy a simple web application that presents an HTML-based user interface. A serverless backend enables the application to upload images and automatically get captions describing them.

![Running web app](media/functions-first-serverless-web-app/0-app-screenshot-finished.png)

The following diagram shows the Azure services used by the application:

1. Blob Storage serves static web content (HTML, CSS, JS) and stores images.
2. Azure Functions manages image uploads, resizing, and metadata storage.
3. Cosmos DB stores image metadata.
4. Logic Apps gets image captions from Computer Vision API.
5. Azure Active Directory manages user authentication.
